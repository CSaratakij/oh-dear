Game for Ludumdare 38

# Fuck...
- Theme : A Small World -> Suck...
- I spent a whole damn day come up with idea -> 2 day left
- Turns out -> I don't satify with game idea in mid development. (And 1/3 game implemented)
- Fuck it -> I'm done.
- I really give up this time..(not the same reason like my last ludumdare which is "lazy" but this time -> I try my best but still -> My art is really block...
